# AB Test To Increase Revenue ðŸ†ŽðŸ“ˆ

Compile Hypotheses to Help Increase Revenue.
I am an analyst at a large online store. Together with the marketing department, we've compiled a list of hypotheses that can help increase revenue.

We need to prioritize these hypotheses, launch an A/B test, and analyze the results.

The archive (hypotheses_us.csv) contains nine possibilities to increase the revenue of an online store with Reach, Impact, Confidence and Effort specified for each.

A/B test was perfomed and obtained the results described in the and (orders_us.csv) and (visitors_us.csv)

**hypotheses_us.csv:**

*Hypotheses: brief descriptions of the hypotheses*

*Reach: User reach, on a scale of one to ten*

*Impact: impact on users, on a scale of one to ten*

*Confidence: confidence in the hypothesis, on a scale of one to ten*

*Effort: the resources necessary to test a hypothesis, on a scale of one to ten. The higher the value of Effort, the more resources are required for the test.*

**orders_us.csv:**

*transactionId: Identifier of the request*

*visitorId: identifier of the user who placed the order*

*date*

*revenue*

*group: the A/B test group to which the user belongs*

**visits_us.csv:**

*date*

*group: A/B test group*

*visits: the number of visits on the specified date for the specified A/B test group*
